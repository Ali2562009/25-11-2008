  <h2>Chapter 1: The Tree in Silence</h2>
  <p>In the quiet hum of the second-year classroom, among the shuffle of papers and soft scratching of pencils, I sat unnoticed by most. I was still discovering myself—dark-haired, a little rough around the edges, and carrying an energy that was quietly my own. It was the time when friendship was tentative, laughter shared in bursts, and eyes often wandered with curiosity.</p>
  <p>And then there was Nour. An artist with a gentle hand, a quiet heart, and a mind that noticed things others didn’t. She picked up her pencil one afternoon and began to draw. Not a random doodle, not a simple sketch—this was alive. Every line shaded with care, every branch breathing life. And at the top, she wrote two words: <em>I Mahmoud</em>. Beside them, a heart, small but perfect.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t just the drawing that lingered in memory—on the <strong>second day of the first term</strong>, she had also asked about my birthday, a small question that revealed she noticed me more than anyone else. That subtle curiosity, that tiny gesture, made me feel quietly seen in a way that mattered more than words could say.</p>
  <p>I didn’t know how to feel when I saw it later. Surprise, confusion, a strange warmth in my chest—these emotions collided all at once. The tree was hers, but in some small, quiet way, it had become ours. It was a secret. A whisper. A spark.</p>
  <p>Neither of us spoke of it then. The drawing rested in the quiet corners of memory, a tiny monument to something unspoken, something budding, yet unclaimed. And so it remained, hidden in time, a fragile beginning that would echo far beyond that second-year classroom.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Chapter 2: A Quiet Curiosity and a Boundary</h2>
  <p>The new term had just begun, and with it, a faint sense of nervous excitement floated through the classroom. Time moved quickly, and by the start of third prep, life had grown more complicated. I found myself wrestling with my own thoughts, weighed down by mental storms that clouded my days. And still, my mind often wandered to Nour—the girl who had once drawn a tree for me, left a secret trail of care, and quietly asked about the day I was born.</p>
  <p>Summoning courage, I asked her about her Instagram. She paused, hesitated, and then simply said <em>“okay”</em>—but did not give me the name. Her response carried caution, a soft line drawn between friendship and something more. Later, she spoke, gently but firmly: <em>“I don’t accept boys.”</em></p>
  <p>And then, almost shyly, she added <em>“sorry.”</em></p>
  <p>That single word carried more meaning than she might have imagined. It wasn’t rejection—it was a soft shield, a careful attempt not to hurt. I, understanding the weight of her honesty and the care in her tone, smiled quietly and replied, <em>“No worries, it’s your choice.”</em></p>
  <p>I left swiftly after, leaving her space, letting the silence speak for me. That brief interaction etched itself into memory—a lesson in patience, understanding, and the quiet power of respecting someone’s heart.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Chapter 3: Messages, Gifts, and Quiet Devotion</h2>
  <p>As the year moved forward, the rhythms of school life carried Nour and me along separate paths, yet my thoughts remained tethered to her. After the third prep exams, unable to contain my feelings, I sent her messages—careful, heartfelt, a quiet release of emotions I had carried in secret. Words that spoke of admiration, of curiosity, of longing, and of a bond I hoped she might feel too.</p>
  <p>Months later, on <strong>the 25th of November, 2023</strong>, I gave her a birthday gift—a simple token, yet chosen with thought, care, and an unspoken devotion. It was not extravagant, but it carried the weight of attention, affection, and the desire to make her feel remembered. She may not have openly said much in return, but the gesture lingered in the delicate spaces between us, a silent reminder of the respect, admiration, and hope I had nurtured.</p>
  <p>Through these moments, I learned patience, humility, and the quiet art of caring from afar. Even when words were unspoken, or when responses were minimal, my heart remained steadfast, quietly devoted, and resilient. The threads of our story were delicate, yet undeniably strong, weaving a narrative of longing, care, and silent love that would not fade with time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Chapter 4: Paths Diverging, Hearts Lingering</h2>
  <p>The summer brought new rhythms and responsibilities. Nour began working at a clinic, tending to others with care and precision, her days full of learning, growth, and independence. I, meanwhile, spent my time helping my mother in the bookstore—stacking books, assisting customers, quietly building my own patience, discipline, and character. Though our daily worlds were different, the invisible threads that connected us remained taut, pulsing with memories of shared glances, gifts, and unspoken feelings.</p>
  <p>Though separated by circumstance, my thoughts often wandered to Nour. The tree, the birthday gift, the soft apology, and her shy curiosity about my birthday—all lingered in my mind, reminding me of the delicate intimacy that had quietly formed between us. And in turn, she, perhaps unknowingly, carried traces of me too: the memory of someone who had shown care, patience, and respect beyond what many others could offer.</p>
  <p>As the new term approached, both of us would return to school changed—older, a little wiser, with new experiences that shaped our hearts. And yet, despite time, distance, and life’s shifting currents, the quiet connection between us remained, a thread of possibility that could one day be woven into something fuller, something mutual, something truly ours.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Chapter 5: Present-Day Longing and Hope</h2>
  <p>Now, the story finds me in the quiet of my own reflections. Thoughts of Nour have grown deeper, more persistent, threading through each day with an intensity I cannot ignore. The messages I sent, the moments we shared, the birthday gift—all echo in the chambers of memory, reminders of a connection that has never truly faded.</p>
  <p>She, too, occupies a space in my mind that no one else can reach. Her soft gestures, the way she once drew me, the gentle apologies and careful boundaries—all of it forms a mosaic of her presence in my heart. I find myself caught between longing and patience, hope and restraint. Every glance, every smile, every interaction becomes a small universe of possibility, a reminder that the story is not yet finished.</p>
  <p>Though uncertainty lingers—questions of timing, feelings, and readiness—my heart remains steadfast. I understand now, more than ever, that love is not only about grand gestures, but also about respect, subtlety, and the quiet courage to wait while the world turns. And so, I hold onto hope, a steady flame, believing that one day, our hearts may find a meeting point, soft and certain, where all the past whispers finally become a shared story.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Chapter 6: Epilogue – The Story Yet to Come</h2>
  <p>The classrooms, the tree, the quiet smiles, and the small gifts—they are chapters already written. But the pages ahead remain blank, waiting for both of us to fill them with shared moments, laughter, and whispered secrets.</p>
  <p>I imagine a day when Nour walks past me in the hallway, our eyes meeting not with hesitation, but with recognition—recognition of all the small gestures, all the unspoken words, all the silent devotion that has lingered for years. Perhaps we will talk, laugh, and find that the bond that began so quietly in prep school has only grown stronger, patiently nurtured by distance, time, and mutual respect.</p>
  <p>In this future, the boundaries once drawn softly, the apologies once whispered, and the shy curiosities once asked—like my birthday—become bridges, guiding us toward one another. My steadfast heart, full of care and patience, and her gentle, thoughtful nature may finally intertwine, creating a story that is ours alone.</p>
  <p>And so, the tale of I and Nour is not one of endings, but of possibilities—of love that has waited, quietly, for the perfect moment, ready to blossom fully when the world allows. <strong>And the story continues…</strong></p>
